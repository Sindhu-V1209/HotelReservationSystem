# HotelReservationSystem

This Hotel Reservation System allows users to interact with a hotel management platform where they can search for available rooms, make reservations, and view booking details. It demonstrates core object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Java, such as class design, object manipulation, and user interaction.

Key Features:
Room Categorization: Rooms are categorized into different types, such as Standard, Deluxe, and Suite, each with its own price.
Room Availability Search: Users can view available rooms and their details, such as room number, type, price, and availability status.
Make a Reservation: Users can enter their name, select a room type, and if an available room is found, the system reserves it for them and updates the room’s availability.
View Reservation Details: Once a room is booked, the user can see the details of the reservation, including room info and total payment.
Basic Payment Handling: The system calculates the total price for the reserved room and displays it as part of the reservation details.
Core Concepts:
Object-Oriented Design: The system uses three primary classes—Room, Reservation, and Hotel—to handle different parts of the reservation process. Each class has its own attributes and methods to manage responsibilities.

Room: Handles room attributes like number, type, price, and availability.
Reservation: Stores customer name and booking details.
Hotel: Manages the room list, searches for available rooms, and processes reservations.
User Interaction: The main method provides a menu where users can:

View available rooms.
Make a reservation.
Exit the system.
Data Storage: An ArrayList is used to store all rooms in the hotel, which allows for dynamic storage and searching of room availability.

Menu-Driven Program: The user selects options through a console menu, making the system interactive and user-friendly.

Benefits:
Practical Learning: This project provides a real-world application of OOP concepts and user input handling in Java.
Modular Structure: The use of separate classes makes the system easier to maintain, modify, or extend with additional features like payment gateways, cancellation, and booking history.
User-Friendly: The simple menu-driven interface makes it easy for users to search for rooms and book them.
This project is perfect for beginners to intermediate programmers looking to understand how to design a system with OOP and create a basic hotel management system.
